Megaman Player Model (Rev 4: 05/05/1998)

Created by Devin Steinke A.K.A. Pyros

This model has taken most of my time for the past month now, and finally here is the release
version!  I hope you are pleased with it.  There should be more to come in the future.

[Installation Instructions]

Simply unzip the file with a long filename compatable program (winzip for instance).  Make
sure you extract it into the Quake 2 folder with the folder structure turned on.  Alternatly
you can extract all the files into the Quake2\baseq2\players\megaman folder.  Just start the
game normally and select Megaman from the multiplayer screen, grab your favorite skin and
start fraggin'!

[Credits]

First and foremost, I would like to thank Steven "Biomech" Hand.  Without his help, support,
and bad attitude :) none of this would have been poissible.  Next of course, I want to thank
everyone who participated in skinning Megaman.  I don't think I could have gotten the model
out as fast without your guy's support!
